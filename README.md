# Color Memory Game

Welcome to the Color Memory Game, a project created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This game was built to help me improvise my JavaScript skills while providing an enjoyable experience for players testing their memory and pattern recognition abilities.

## Project Overview:

The Color Memory Game presents users with a fun challenge. The objective is to test your memory and concentration by mimicking a series of colors and sounds. You must then replicate this sequence by clicking on the colored boxes in the correct order.

How to Play
Start the Game: Open the game in your browser, and you'll see a colorful interface representing the game board.

Listen and Watch: Pay close attention to the sequence of colors. Each color will be accompanied by a distinct sound.

Repeat the Pattern: After the sequence is complete, it's your turn. Click on the colors in the same order as they appeared in the original pattern.

Keep Going: The game will become progressively more challenging as you successfully repeat the patterns. The sequence will lengthen with each level, testing your memory and concentration.

Game Over: Be careful, though! One wrong click, and it's game over. You can start again and see how high a level you can reach.

## Features:

Engaging and interactive user interface.
Auditory cues for added fun and challenge.
Progressive difficulty levels to test your memory.
Simple and responsive design created with HTML and CSS.
